                    No matter what side you're on, both sides seem to agree on one thing: love. But is love really that universal and ubiquitous?
                    It's time we make politics more complicated and divided by indroducing the all new Love Compass! 
                </p>
                <p>The compass has two axis represented two different things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>X-axis</b>: view on love
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Far left</b>: amor hortator
                                <p>This side is very pro-love and it is a big part of their lives.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Far right</b>: amor vetitum
                                <p>This side is very anti-love.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        <b>Y-axis</b>: how one enforces their views

                            <li>
                                <b>Top</b>: summa
                                <p>Summas will enforce their beliefs in any way possible at every time of the day.</p>

                                <p>This side doesn't care what others do, regardless of wether that aligns with their personal beliefs.</p>
                            </li>
